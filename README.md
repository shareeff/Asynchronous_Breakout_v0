## Credit

The Original implementation of this [project](https://github.com/Zeta36/Asynchronous-Methods-for-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning). I just add tensorboard 
functionalities and also modify it for openAI gym environment. The original project was gamming environment (pong & tetris) written in pygame library.
